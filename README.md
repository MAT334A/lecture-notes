Lecture Notes for Math 334.

The markdown files in the `src` directory are compiled by [`mdbook`](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html). Pushing new commits to this repository should cause a re-build of the book and update the published version of the book.

The published version of the book can be accessed on [GitHub pages](https://mat334a.github.io/lecture-notes/week_1/cs_inequality_derivation.html).
