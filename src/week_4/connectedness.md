# The Notion of Connectedness

{{#include ../tex_common.md}}

Or ... rather, the notion of disconnectedness.

We say a set \\(S \in \R^n\\) is ***dis*connected** if there exists a partition of \\(S\\) into some \\(S_1\\), \\(S_2\\) (that is, \\(S_1 \cup S_2 = S\\)) such that \\(S_1 \cap \bar{S_2} = \bar{S_1} \cap S_2 = \emptyset\\). Intuitively, if I can divide a set into two parts such that the two parts do not touch each other, then the set is disconnected. If a set is not disconnected, then it is **connected**. (No partition into two sets \\(S_1 \cup S_2 = S\\) satisfies \\(S_1 \cap \bar{S_2} = \bar{S_1} \cap S_2 = \emptyset\\).)

Note: by this definition, if \\(S\\) is the union of the (open) unit balls centered at \\((0, 0)\\) and \\((1, 0)\\), then \\(S\\) is disconnected. 

# Connectedness Theorems

Here's a simple one. If \\(S \subseteq \R\\) is not an interval, then it is not connected.

**Proof:** Given \\(S\\) is not an interval, there exist some \\(a, b, c \in \R\\) such that \\(a, c \in S\\) and \\(b \not\in S\\) where \\(a < b < c\\). Therefore, consider \\(S_1 = (-\infty, b) \cap S\\) and \\(S_2 = (b, \infty) \cap S\\). Note that \\(S_1 \cup S_2 = (\R \setminus \\\{b\\\}) \cap S = S\\), and \\(\overline{S}_1 \subseteq (-\infty, b]\\), \\(\overline{S}_2 \subseteq [b, \infty)\\).

\\(b \not\in S_1\\) and \\(b \not\in S_2\\). Therefore, we have found two sets that partition \\(S\\). Therefore, \\(S\\) is disconnected. <span style="float: right;">😃</span>

Here's another: Continuous functions map connected sets to connected sets. In other words, \\(\left(\left(f : S \to D\right) \wedge \textsf{Continuous}(f)\right) \implies \left(\textsf{Connected}(S) \to \textsf{Connected}\left(\textsf{Image}_S(f)\right)\right)\\).

**Proof:** Suppose \\(D\\) is disconnected `TODO`

# The Notion of Pathwise Connectedness

Intuitively, a set is pathwise connected if, for all points in that set, we can construct a curve between any two of them for which all points of the curve are in the set.s

Formally, a set, \\(S \subseteq D\\) is pathwise connected iff \\(\forall a, b \in S, \exists f : [0, 1] \to D, \textsf{Continuous}\_D(f) \wedge f(0) = a \wedge f(1) = b\\).

Pathwise connectedness is also known as "arcwise connectedness".

> \\(S\\) cannot be divided into two non-empty sets whose closures don't intersect, so \\(S\\) is connected.

> To see why, consider a point on the vertical line segment, \\(\left\\\{ (0, y) : y \in [-1, 1]\right\\\}\\). If we tried to draw a path from that point to the point \\(\left(\frac{1}{\pi}, 0\right)\\), we couldn't! The path from our point to \\(\left(\frac{1}{\pi}, 0\right)\\) must be larger than any real quantity (to see why, look at the graph).
