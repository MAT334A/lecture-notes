# Using the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality can be used to show, among other things, that the correlation between two vectors is at most 1, and the triangle inequality (that the two shorter sides of a triangle \\(||a||\\) and \\(||b||\\) have a larger combined length than the longest side of the triangle).
