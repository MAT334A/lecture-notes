## Continuity of a Function Over ℝⁿ

**Theorem:** If \\(f: D \to \R^n\\), then \\(f\\) is continuous iff its components are continuous.

## Continuity and Composition

Say we have functions \\(f : A \to B\\) and \\(g : B \to C\\) and \\(f\\) is continuous over \\(A\\) and \\(g\\) is continuous over \\(B\\).

![f maps from A to B and g maps from B to C. We can think of this as f taking every point in a blob, A, to a point in a blob, B, and g acting similarly.](./mapping_from_a_to_b_to_c.svg)
