# The Completeness Axiom

The Completeness Axiom states that for a well-ordered set \\(S\\), given any subset \\(X\\) with an upper bound \\(a\\) (that is, \\(X\\) has the property that there is an element \\(a \in S\\) such that for any \\(x \in X\\), \\(x < a\\), then there exists a _least_ upper bound \\(\alpha \in S\\) of \\(X\\) such that \\(\alpha\\) is an upper bound, and for any \\(a < \alpha\\), there is some \\(x \in S\\) such that \\(x \ge a\\). Also, if a subset has a lower bound \\(b\\), then there exists a _greatest_ upper bound \\(\beta\\).

We will take this as an axiom for the real numbers. This axiom does not apply to the rationals - consider the subset of rationals less than (or greater than) some irrational number. 

We need the completeness axioms for some convergence proofs.
