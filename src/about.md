These lecture notes use `mdbook`. To build the book, follow this [guide for testing locally](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html) or view the [version of this document on GitHub pages](https://mat334a.github.io/lecture-notes/).

When new commits are added to the GitHub repository for this work, the website should re-build and self-update.
