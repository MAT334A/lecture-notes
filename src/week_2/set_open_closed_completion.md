# Open, Closed, and Completion

{{#include ../tex_common.md}}

We've learned what open and closed sets are. We know what it means to complete a set, but how does completing a set change its boundary? Let's investigate.

## The boundary of the completion of a set

In other words, \\(\forall x \in \R, \forall r, B(x, r) \cap \Q \neq \emptyset \wedge B(x, r) \cap \Q^C \neq \emptyset\\), satisfying our definition of a boundary point. As such, \\(\partial Q = \R\\).

Let \\(S\\) be an arbitrary set. Then \\(\overline{\bar{S}} = \overline{S}\\).
