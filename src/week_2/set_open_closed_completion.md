# Open, Closed, and Completion

{{#include ../tex_common.md}}

We've learned what open and closed sets are. We know what it means to complete a set, but how does completing a set change its boundary? Let's investigate.

## \\(\partial \overline{S} \subseteq \partial S\\)

This was used as a lemma in the quiz section notes, but it's useful in its own right, so let's call it a theorem.

Let \\(x \in \partial \overline{S}\\). We want to show that a ball, \\(B(x, r)\\) (for arbitary \\(r\\)), intersects both points in \\(S\\) and in \\(S^c\\). If we do this, we've satisfied the definition of a boundary point of \\(S\\) for every point \\(x \in \partial \overline{S}\\).

Now, because \\(x \in \partial \overline{S}\\), \\(B(x, r)\\) contains some \\(y \in \overline{S}\\) and \\(z \in \left(\overline{S}\right)^c\\) for any choice of \\(r > 0\\). 

Let's first show the existence of some point in \\(B(x, r)\\) also in \\(S\\). Expanding the definition of \\(\overline{S}\\),
\\[
\begin{aligned}
 &y\in \overline{S}\\\\
 \implies& y \in S \cup \partial S\\\\
\end{aligned}
\\]

As such, \\(y\\) is in either \\(S\\) or \\(\partial S\\) (or both!).
 * If \\(y \in S\\), then we're done (with this part)! We've shown that \\(y\\), a point in \\(B(x, r)\\), is also in \\(S\\)!
 * If \\(y \in \partial S\\), then as \\(B(x, r)\\) is an open set, there exists a ball with a sufficiently small radius centered at \\(y\\), \\(B(y, r_2)\\) such that $\\(B(y, r_2) \subseteq B(x, r)\\). As \\(y\\) is a boundary point of \\(S\\), the ball \\(B(y, r_2)\\) must contain a point \\(y' \in S\\) (and some point in \\(S^c\\)). Therefore, as \\(y' \in B(y, r_2) \subseteq B(x, r)\\), we know that \\(y'\\) is a point in \\(B(x, r)\\) also in \\(S\\), completing this case.

We now just need to show that our ball contains a point in \\(S^c\\). We'll do this using point \\(z \in \left(\overline{S}\right)^c\\):
\\[
\begin{aligned}
 &z \in \overline{S}^c\\\\
 \implies& z \in \left(S \cup \partial S\right)^c\\\\
 \implies& z \in S^c \cap \left(\partial S\right)^c && \texttt{...from DeMorgan's laws}
\end{aligned}
\\]

From this, we have that \\(z \in S^c\\) because if \\(z\\) is in **both** \\((\partial S)^c\\) and \\(S^c\\), it must be in \\(S^c\\).

Because we've shown that a ball of arbitrary size centered at \\(x\\) must contain a point in \\(S^c\\) and \\(S\\), and so, because \\(x\\) is an arbitrary point in \\(\partial \overline{S}\\), we have that every point in \\(\overline{S}\\) satisfies the definition of a boundary point of \\(S\\).

We can therefore conclude that \\(\partial \overline{S} \subseteq S\\).<span style="float: right;">â˜º</span>

> As such, if we choose _any_ real number \\(x\\), a ball with positive radius centered at \\(x\\) will contain rational numbers, as well as the irrational numbers between them. In other words, \\(\forall x \in \R, \forall r, B(x, r) \cap \Q \neq \emptyset \land B(x, r) \cap \Q^C \neq \emptyset\\), satisfying our definition of a boundary point. As such, \\(\partial Q = \R\\).

>

## Closing Closed Sets

Say we have an arbitrary set \\(S\\). Must \\(\bar{S}\\) be closed?

By definition, \\(\bar{S} = S \cup \partial S\\). As such, because \\(\partial S \subseteq \partial S \cup S\\), we have that \\(\partial S \subseteq\bar{S}\\).

As we've proved that \\(\partial \overline{S} \subseteq \partial S\\), we conclude that \\(\partial \bar{S} \subseteq\bar{S}\\) and therefore \\(\bar{S}\\) is closed.

## The boundary of the completion of a set

Let \\(S\\) be an arbitrary set. Then \\(\overline{\bar{S}} = \overline{S}\\). Let's prove it!

We defined \\(\overline{S} = \partial S \cup S\\). As such,
\\[
\begin{aligned}
   \overline{\bar{S}} &= \partial \bar{S} \cup \bar{S}\\\\
   &= \partial \bar{S} \cup \left(S \cup \partial S\right)
\end{aligned}
\\]

Above we showed that \\(\partial \bar{S} \subseteq \partial S\\). As such, \\(\partial\bar{S} \subseteq \overline{\bar{S}}\\), satisfying the definition of "closed".<span style="float: right;">â˜º</span>

## Unions or Intersections of a Finite Number of Open or Closed Sets

Unions or intersections of many sets which are all open or all closed more or less behave as one might expect, provided that "many" is still finite. We will present the proof that the intersection of a finite number of open sets is open, the union of a finite number of open sets is open, and leave the other two cases as an exercise.

Let us first show that the intersection of a finite number of open sets is open. Suppose that \\(S = \cap_{i = 1}^n S_i\\) for a finite positive integer \\(n\\) and open sets \\(S_i\\). To prove that \\(S\\) is open, it suffices to show that every point \\(x \in S\\) is an interior point of \\(S\\).

Let \\(x \in S\\) be given. We must have \\(x \in S_i\\) for all \\(S_i\\). As \\(S_i\\) is open, there exists some \\(r_i > 0\\) such that for any \\(0 < r \le r_i\\), we know that \\(B(x, r)\\) is a subset of \\(S_i\\). 

Consider the values \\(R: \\{r_1, r_2, ..., r_n\\}\\). Let \\(r_k \in R\\) be such that \\(r_i \ge r_k\\) for any \\(r_i \in R\\). Therefore, \\(B(x, r_k)\\) is a subset of every \\(S_i\\), and is therefore a subset of \\(S\\). Therefore, there exists a ball at \\(x\\) with some positive radius that is a subset of \\(S\\), so \\(x\\) is an interior point of \\(S\\).<span style="float: right;">â˜º</span>

The proof that the union of a finite number of open sets is open is even simpler. Consider \\(S = \cup_{i = 1}^n S_i\\), similar to before. We just need to show that every point \\(x \in S\\) is an interior point of \\(S\\).

Let \\(x \in S\\) be given. By the construction of \\(S\\), we know that there is at least one set \\(S_i\\) such that \\(x \in S_i\\). As \\(S_i\\) is open, there exists some positive \\(r\\) such that \\(B(x, r)\\) is a subset of \\(S_i\\). But since \\(B(x, r)\\) is a subset of \\(S_i\\), we know that \\(B(x, r)\\) is a subset of \\(S\\). Therefore, there exists a ball at \\(x\\), namely, \\(B\\), with some positive radius that is a subset of \\(S\\), so \\(x\\) is an interior point of \\(S\\).<span style="float: right;">â˜º</span>

> Note that, by knowing that the intersection of a finite number of open sets is itself open, you can show that the union of a finite number of closed sets is itself closed. What do we know about the **complement** of the union of a finite number of closed sets? Using a similar method, can you show that the intersection of a finite number of closed sets is itself closed?

## How About Infinite Sets?

As it turns out, two of the statements we proved in the above section become false if we allow ourselves to consider an infinite amount of sets. Namely, the intersection of an infinite number of open sets is not necessarily open, and the union of an infinite number of closed sets is not necessarily closed. The latter is a homework problem (ðŸ˜‰) so we won't provide a counterexample for that one, but we will show by example the existence of a set of infinite open sets whose intersection is not open.

Consider the infinite series of sets \\(\\{S_1, S_2, ...\\}\\) where \\(S_i = B\left(0, \frac{1}{i}\right)\\). Let \\(S = \cap_{i = 1}^{\infty} S_i\\). Let us show that \\(S\\) is not open.

> Sidenote: Remember that closed is not the exact opposite of open, so it isn't enough to show that \\(S\\) is closed!

To show that \\(S\\) is not open, we just need to find a point in \\(S\\) that is not an interior point. All points in any set are either an interior point or a boundary point, so it suffices to show the existence of a point \\(x \in S\\) that is a boundary point, that is, a ball of any radius at \\(x\\) will intersect both \\(S\\) and \\(S^c\\).

Proposition. \\(0 \in S\\) is not an interior point of \\(S\\).

To show that \\(0\\) is in \\(S\\), we just need to show that \\(\forall i \in \N \quad 0 \in S_i\\). This is true as \\(S_i = B\left(0, \frac{1}{i}\right)\\), the center is always in the ball as the ball has a positive radius.

To show that \\(0\\) is not an interior point of \\(S\\), we can prove that for any \\(r\\) there exists some point \\(x \in B(0, r)\\) that is not in \\(S\\). Consider a ball of radius \\(r > 0\\) around \\(0\\). Let \\(N = \lceil \frac{1}{r} \rceil + 1\\), thus, as \\(r\\) is positive, \\(N > \frac{1}{r} \implies 0 < \frac{1}{N} < r\\). 

Now, consider a point \\(x\\) such that \\(||x|| = \frac{\frac{1}{N} + r}{2}\\). As \\(||x||\\) is the average of \\(\frac{1}{N}\\) and \\(r\\), we know that \\(||x||\\) is strictly between the two numbers. Thus, \\(x \not\in S_N = B\left(0, \frac{1}{N}\right)\\), but \\(x \in B(0, r)\\). But if \\(x \not\in S_N\\), then \\(x \not\in S\\). Therefore, the intersection of any ball around \\(0\\) and the complement of \\(S\\) is not empty, demonstrating that \\(0\\) is not an interior point and therefore \\(S\\) is not open.<span style="float: right;">â˜º</span>
